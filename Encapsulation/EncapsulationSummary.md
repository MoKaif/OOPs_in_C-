# Encapsulation in C#

Encapsulation is a fundamental principle of object-oriented programming that involves bundling data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. This concept aims to control access to the internal state of an object, promoting modularity, security, and code organization.

## Introduction

In C#, encapsulation is primarily achieved through properties, which are special methods that allow controlled access to the internal fields of a class. Properties use the `get` and `set` accessors to retrieve and modify the values, providing a level of abstraction over the underlying implementation.

## Key Points about Encapsulation in C#

1. **Properties:**
   - Encapsulation in C# is commonly implemented using properties, which act as accessors for private fields.
   - The `get` accessor retrieves the value of a property, and the `set` accessor modifies it.

2. **Access Modifiers:**
   - Use access modifiers (e.g., `public`, `private`) to control the visibility of properties and fields.
   - Private fields are often used to store the internal state, limiting direct access from outside the class.

3. **Auto-implemented Properties:**
   - C# provides a concise syntax for properties through auto-implemented properties.
   - Auto-implemented properties automatically generate a private backing field.

4. **Read-only Properties:**
   - Create read-only properties by omitting the `set` accessor.
   - These properties can only be initialized during object creation or within the class.

5. **Write-only Properties:**
   - Create write-only properties by omitting the `get` accessor.
   - These properties are useful when you only need to set values.

6. **Validation and Logic:**
   - Encapsulation allows the inclusion of validation and additional logic within the `set` accessor.
   - This ensures that the assigned values meet specific criteria.

7. **Security and Abstraction:**
   - Encapsulation provides a level of security by hiding the internal details of a class from external code.
   - Abstraction allows changes to the internal implementation without affecting the external code that uses the class.

8. **Encapsulation vs. Information Hiding:**
   - While encapsulation promotes bundling data and methods, information hiding goes a step further by restricting access to internal details.

Understanding and effectively applying encapsulation in C# is crucial for building robust and maintainable software systems.
